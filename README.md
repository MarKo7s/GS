# Gerchbergâ€“Saxton (GS) algortim for phase and amplitude light control

![alt text](images/GS_white.png)

# Code implementations:

It works with LG mode bases. All the implementations requiere fibremodes module avaliable in my other repositories.

## modemasks.py

Used to generate LG mode phase masks libraries

## pyPhasemasks.py


Generate arbitrary fields phase-masks based on LG coeficients

## pyBeamshaper.py

Used to perform beamshaping at the tip of an already characterised multimode fibre employing an LCoS (module avalibale in my other repositories)
